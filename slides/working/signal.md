## Signal v Noise

Note: This is where our largest issue with data comes inâ€” detecting the signal vs the noise. There are so many factors that go into our page load, from 3rd party partners to advertisements. We have taken an approach to keep monitoring sites with Ads, but also without Ads/3rd parties. Although we have gotten mostly positive results, we are not certain we have the right work in place to ensure that we are definitely getting signal through the noise.
