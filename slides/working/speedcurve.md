## SpeedCurve

Note: We use SpeedCurve to monitor the performance of all of our sites constantly. Running several tests a day against each vertical, competitors to those verticals, at different speeds, and with and without 3rd party scripts. Each of these provides valuable insights into how our sites are performing, and we are starting to use the budgets to control our sites' growth.
