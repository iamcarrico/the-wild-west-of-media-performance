### Font Face Observer

By Bram Stein

Note: In comes Font Face Observer. For where we can, we wanted to load our fonts as asynchronously as possibleâ€” and ensure that we are not delaying any content for the fonts. Our first forray into this used Font Face Observer. We worked very closely with Bram to ensure that we had the lowest error rate in the library as possible.
