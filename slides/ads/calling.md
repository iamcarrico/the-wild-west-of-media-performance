## Ad Calling


Note: Our ad code and system was build many moons ago, but has been so critical to our business, that we have only built onto the system instead of re-thinking it from the ground up. There was a lot of little things that we do not use anymore, or has dependencies that could be written out fairly inexpensively.

We tried several ways to make ads both asynchronous and more efficient. It took several layers of work by different teams— as well as some ideation that proved itself to not have the desired effects. But we just launched on Curbed a comprehensive rewrite of our ads— while pushing all other JS to the footer. We currently have all important JS inlined, although we may re-consider that as more testing is done.
