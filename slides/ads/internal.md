Note: We have some internal tools to help drive better ad creation. We built testing through Web Page Test to ensure the performance of every ad we build is as fast as possible. Every one of our internal ads gets a Web Page Test on it, then we grade it with a simple rocket, green for good, yellow for okay, red for bad. We open this up to the people creating ads, so that they know when there might be a problem with the ad.
