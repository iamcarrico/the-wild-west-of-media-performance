## Webp

<!-- .element: class="fragment" --><video autoplay loop><source src="https://iamcarrico.github.io/the-wild-west-of-media-performance/resources/video/webp.mp4" type="video/mp4" /></video> <br/>Huge win!

Note:

- Thumbor could do Webp, which only works in Chrome
- user base 50%+ Chrome users
- So I built support for webp
- Huge win!
