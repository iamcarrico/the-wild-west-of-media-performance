## Delivery

Note:

Once you know *when* you want to load an image, you can choose the way that you deliver it.

If you want to use the leverage the preloader you only have two choices
* <IMG> element
* <PICTURE> element
  * We recently started using the Picture element to delivery responsive images and select the best MIME type for that browser.
