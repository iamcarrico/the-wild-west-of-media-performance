## Webp

<!-- .element: class="fragment" --><video autoplay loop><source src="https://iamcarrico.github.io/the-wild-west-of-media-performance/resources/video/webp.mp4" type="video/mp4" /></video> <br/>Huge win!

Note:

- I knew of Webp
- Our sites 50%+ Chrome
- Thumbor supports
- So I deployed it
- Huge win!

Thumbor also had the ability to support a bunch of formats, including Google's Webp which is supported on Chrome. We generally see something like 50% + Chrome usage on most of our sites so adding support for Webp could be high impact. And it was! Probably our first big win resulted in decreased load times for a large percentage of our users - ranging anywhere from 30-90% depending on the page.
