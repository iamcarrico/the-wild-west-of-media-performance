## Delivery

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> `<img>`
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Lazy-loading / JavaScript
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> ` <picture>`

Note: There are three major options to how you deliver your image assets. Straight image tag, the boring old school way. Lazying loading images within JavaScript. Or using the picture element. Each have their own reasons for being usedâ€” and times that they are the most effective.
