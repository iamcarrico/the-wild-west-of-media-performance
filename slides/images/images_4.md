### Preloader via Picture element
<!-- .element: class="fragment" --><img src="resources/images/images/picture_element.gif" /> <br />Not bad


Note:

Lazy loading is good for loading non-critical image which also saves...
* bandwidth on both sides
* reduces client resouce contention (network & CPU)


But if you want to load responsive images quickly you should leverage the browsers preloader
* using the Picture element
