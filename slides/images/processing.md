### [Thumbor](http://thumbor.org/) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: We have some very image heavy sites, and we want to make sure that our images are as small as possible to display. It would be impossible for us to preprocess every image for the many different variants that we haveâ€” but we can do real-time processing with each images as they are being requested. For this, we use the open source library Thumbor.
