# Thumbor + Lazy loading

Note:

- already thumbor + lazy loading
- a cool stack but we could do more

We were already using and open source, real time image processing solution called Thumbor to do all of resizing and cropping. The front end of our sites also already used responsive images - using a Javascript based lazy loading technique.
