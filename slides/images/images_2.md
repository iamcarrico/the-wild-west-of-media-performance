## Timing

Note:

The first thing to consider is timing. 
  
At what point in the load cycle of a page should you load a given image?
    
We consider certain image types more important than others

For us, the logo and lede images need to be loaded first. That gets our branding and content in front of readers eyes ASAP.

Everything else, like images below "the fold" we can load them later. And we really only want to load non-critical images if the image area is in the viewport.
