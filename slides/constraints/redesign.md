### Redesign

![Nope, we can't call the hotline](https://iamcarrico.github.io/the-wild-west-of-media-performance/resources/images/constraints/design-bling.gif)

Note: We were not going to be going through a redesign, especially not for all our our 8 verticals that we will be touching. Unlike a lot of new sites that come out that think about performance as a constraint of the design, we had to work with the design that we had as a constraint to performance. This is far from the ideal, but it would be infeasible for us to launch a redesign for all of them just for performance.
