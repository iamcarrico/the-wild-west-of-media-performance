<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> <span style="font-size: 50%;">"d2478ce" was a naughty deploy</span>

Note:

We tie all of our SC tests to GIT hashes. So if we do see a problem on the timeline we can easily figure out what code change likely caused the problem. 

While I was on paternity leave ... (eyes) ... at 12:41 EDT on Jun 6th "d2478ce" was deployed and a regression occured. When I get back to NYC, I'll look up that GIT hash and see what changed and possibly work with the author to get that fixed.
