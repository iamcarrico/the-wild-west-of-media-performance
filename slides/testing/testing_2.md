## RUM

Note:

- Already on
- Good for big picture, not for drilling
- Didn't have SpeedIndex or video
- Need Synthetic

We were already capturing basic Real User Monitoring (RUM) stats for all our sites via Google analytics and had been for several years. That's interesting data but it didn't give us stats like SpeedIndex or video recordings and known networking conditions for those users. We decided we really needed some type of Synthetic testing solution.
