Note:

- some SAAS
- in house
- speedcurve

We evaluated a few different SAAS vendors, played around with an in house solution but eventually settled on using SpeedCurve. SpeedCurve uses Webpagetest as a back end which provided us with all the detail we wanted combined with SpeedCurves historical tracking of all those tests. And we were already familiar with Webpagetest so it was a great fit for us.
