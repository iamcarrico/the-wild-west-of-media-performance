## Flow

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Identify a problem / area of improvement
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Use Chrome dev tools locally while developing a solution
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Push the solve to a sandbox and test with Webpagetest
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Pull request with WPT test validations
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Deploy (kicks off SC tests on all sites)
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Validate deploy went as expected in SpeedCurve

Note:

The typical flow for performance work goes like:
	- Identify a problem / area of improvement
	- Use Chrome dev tools locally while developing a solution
	- Push the solve to a sandbox and test with Webpagetest
	- Pull request with WPT test validations
	- Deploy (kicks off SC tests on all sites)
	- Validate deploy went as expected in SpeedCurve
