### Content varies wildly

<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Even siloed data tells an incomplete story

Note:

Content differs wildly even for the same page type

* Even if we lumped RUM data into page *type* silos, one article maybe have 800kb of content and another may have 2MB. I don't like saying those words out loud but that is the reality of working on a media site.
* Since we're talking about 100k-1M page loads ... and we get averages, the data is not very satisfying.
