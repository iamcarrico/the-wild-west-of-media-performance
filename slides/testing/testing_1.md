## PERFORMANCE TESTING AND TRACKING

Note:


- First order of business

When we started the performance team, our first order of business was to get some sort of performance tracking system in place.


- Get baseline
- Track improvements

We wanted to get a baseline for our sites in their current state. And we needed to be able to validate our future performance work as it was rolled out to production.
