## Notifications

Note:

  We have budgets for various performance stats like SpeedIndex ... if a test detects an infraction, we get a Slack notification. As of right now, they are only really visible to Performance Team members.

  This is a work in progress for us but we've pinged the Speedcurve team about how to make these notifications more helpful. As notfications get better, we hope to send them to some of the higher traffic Slack rooms where they will get more attention.
