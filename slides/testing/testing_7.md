## Notifications

Note:

We have budgets in SpeedCurve, so if a regression occurs or a new bottleneck is introduced which pushes us over budget - we get a notification. Those notifications are ok for Performance Engineers but currently difficult for other team members to grok. So right now, our perf team is the only one that sees them.
