## Give room to tackle big projects

Note: Some of our best work, and best optimizations came from being given the room to re-think what we had in the past. This includes both the image work being done, and our handling of advertisements. Both have saved us huge amounts, but neither would be possible without given time to experiment, fail, experiment, fail, experiment, and succeed.
